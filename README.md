# :video_game: Welcome to the Monster Hunter World Companion app! :video_game:

## :pencil: Features :pencil:
  - **Comparator:** After selecting your monster to hunt and your weapon of choice, the app will return the most optimal weapon for a successful hunt, based on the weapon's element, damage, and monster weakness. All data is fetched from the API https://docs.mhw-db.com/.
    
  - **Monster list:** The app also features a list of monsters, that will contain their basic information in the future. The list can be sorted alphabetically, and monsters can be classified by species.

## :fast_forward: Next steps :fast_forward:
  - Media queries to adapt to bigger screens (laptops and desktops).
  - Authentication functionality, with the ability to store previous searches.
  - Include monster stats in the monster list section.

## :hammer: Tools/Languages used :hammer:
  - **HTML/CSS**
  - **JavaScript:** usage of async functions to fetch information from the API, treat data, and manipulate DOM.
  - **LocalStorage** to store data that was later recovered to be compared and return a weapon.
